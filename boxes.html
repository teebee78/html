        <h1>Headigs are Block Elemets</h1>
        <p>Paramgraphs are blocks, too.<em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements</strong></p>

        <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elemnts do not. </p>

        <p>
            Block boxes always appear below the previous block element. 
            <br>
            The width of block boxes is set automatically based on the width of its parent container.
            <br>
            The default height of block boxes is based on the content it contains.
        </p>
        <h2>Margin, Border and padding</h2>
        Everything inside the border gets a background, margins are always transparent.
        Padding is included in the click area of an element, while margins aren’t.
        Margins collapse vertically, while padding doesn’t (we’ll discuss this more in the next section).
        Inline boxes completely ignore the top and bottom margins of an element.

        <h2>Vertical Margin Collapse</h2>
        When you have two boxes with vertical margins sitting right next to each other, they will collapse. 

        <h2>Content Boxes and Border Boxes</h2>
        The width and height properties only define the size of a box’s content. Its padding and border are both added on top of whatever explicit dimensions you set
        Fortunately, CSS lets you change how the width of a box is calculated via the box-sizing property. 
        By default, it has a value of content-box. Other: border-box;
